## Project Overview
Healio is a user-centric mobile application concept designed to support youth mental health. Developed as part of a User Experience Engineering initiative, the project focuses on creating a safe, inclusive, and stigma-free digital environment for emotional tracking and mental well-being support.

## Problem Statement
Young people often hesitate to seek professional mental health support due to privacy concerns, social stigma, and fear of judgment. The challenge was to design an interface that feels personal, trustworthy, and accessible—bridging the gap between self-care and trusted social support.
